batch data processing tasks to Implement step-by-step code for Extracting data from multiple sources such as cloud storage, and APIs and loading into centralized data store for analysis with ADF

Here is a step-by-step code example for extracting data from multiple sources and loading it into a centralized data store using Azure Data Factory (ADF):

1. Create an Azure Data Factory instancE
2. Create a linked service for your data source(s), for example, Azure Blob Storage
3. Create a dataset for your source data
4. Create a linked service for your centralized data store, for example, Azure SQL Database
5. Create a dataset for your centralized data store
6. Create a pipeline for copying data from the source to the centralized data store
7. Publish the changes to your Azure Data Factory instance
8. Trigger the pipeline to run
